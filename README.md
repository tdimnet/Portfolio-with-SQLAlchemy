# Portfolio-with-SQLAlchemy

Welcome to my project five and final of my Treehouse Techdegree in Python.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- VsCode
- [The VsCode DevContainer extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container)


## Installation steps

- Clone the project
- Open the project with VsCode
- Run the command `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`. This will download the Docker image, add Sqlite to your project and install the required libraries.


## Project commands 

Once in your Docker container, here are the possible commands:

- `python app.py` - run the project
- `sqlite portfolio.db` - opens your Sqlite database


## What I learned with the Techdegree

Thanks to this Techdegree in Python, I was able to strengthen my knowledge of Python.

I had some difficulties with Lambda and List Comprehension and I tried to use them as much as possible during all the projects. I also understood better how to use SQLAlchemy with Flask. 

However I think I would have liked to see other things during this Techdegree such as generators, tests and how to manage relationships between tables with SQLAlchemy.
